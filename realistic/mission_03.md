## Overview
A little girl made a website to post poetry related to peace and understanding.
American fascists have hacked this website replacing it with Hitler-esque
propaganda. Can you repair the website?

From: PeacePoetry

Message: I run this website where people can read and submit peace-related
poetry. I am doing this out of good will towards others, and I don't see why I
would be making enemies out of this, but some real ass hole hacked my website
posting a bunch of ignorant aggressive propaganda on the front page. And I made
that website a while ago, and I no longer have access to it. Do you think you
can hack in and change it back? Please? Oh, and bonus points if you message me
the name of the bastard who did this!

## Solution
Think about the objective of this mission: we want to restore the site to its
state before getting hacked. This means:
* We need to find what the site looked like before getting hacked. In other
words, we need the HTML, because web pages are in HTML.
* Once we find the HTML of what the site looked like, we'll need to find a
mechanism to get that HTML back onto the site.
* It likely follows that if we can find a way to change the code on part of the
site, that's probably the same mechanism the hackers used to deface the site in
the first place.

Click into the mission site and we're taken to the defaced page (the mid-2000s
bent to the hacked content seems so...idyllic, looking back on it now, in 2020).
Check the raw HTML to see if there's anything we can learn, and sure enough, at
the very bottom (you need to scroll all the way to the bottom), there's this
comment:  
`<!--Note to the webmasterThis website has been hacked, but not totally
destroyed. The old website is still up. I simply copied the old index.html file
to oldindex.html and remade this one. Sorry about the inconvenience.-->`

This tells us:
* The old index page is still up. That's where we can get the code of what the
site looked like before getting hacked.
* The hacker copied the original index.html file to oldindex.html and then put
the defaced content on index.html. Seems like whatever vulnerability is at play
allowed the hacker to manipulate multiple files, not just index.html.

Searching queries like [website edit files vulnerability] led me to references
of path traversal and directory traversal. This led me
[here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) and then
[here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal). This seems
important to the end solution. This type of attack involves being able to access
files and directories across a site, similar to what we see happening in this
mission.

Go back to the other detail we discovered, that the old index page is available
at oldindex.html. Try accessing it by going to
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html. This is the
main page of the site before it was hacked, complete with the raw HTML we want
to put back on the real index.html page. We can simply copy the raw HTML if
needed.

The old index page has two links, one to an area to read submitted poems
(https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/readpoems.php) and one to
submit a new poem
(https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php). If you
click any of the poems from
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/readpoems.php, like
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/readpoem.php?name=Hacker,
you'll see the resulting URL contains a query parameter (the name=Hacker) part.
This seems to plug directly into the site's file system API, exactly the sort of
thing the PortSwigger article cautions against.

Finally, from https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php
you'll see there's a way for anyone to submit a poem to the site. There's also
this message:   `Note: Poems will be stored online immediately but will not be
listed on the main poetry page until it has a chance to be looked at.` Again,
this sort of immediate storage implies there isn't any validation happening
first.

Putting it all together, we have our framework for a solution:
* We have the code we need to restore the old HTML on the index.html page.
* The site has open entry points into the file system API, based on what we see
in URLs like https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/readpoem.php?name=Hacker.
* Per the note on https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php,
the site stores user inputs immediately, without any validation check.

Now, visit https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php.
Enter `../index.html` as the Name of poem, which I picked up from the
PortSwigger article about directory traversal. Paste the raw HTML from
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html in the Poem box.
Press add poem, and you're done. Youâ€™ll have successfully rewritten the
index.html file with the original contents, and as you can see, this is exactly
what the hackers did to deface the site in the first place. Now, if only we
could help PeacePoetry get access to the site to fix this underlying problem.

## Key Concept
Directory traversal

## Key Ideas
Directory traversal is probably how a lot of hackers deface legitimate websites as
well as [access
files](https://hackernoon.com/the-power-of-directory-traversal-93e8dfd608ef)
webmasters otherwise intend to keep hidden. The easiest way to prevent this type
of attack is to prevent users from directly accessing the file system API, like
in the way we just did. But if you can't cut off this access entirely,
PortSwigger suggested at least two different types of validation, such as
limiting the types of characters users can enter in input areas (e.g., limit to
alphanumeric characters), or making sure backend commands stay within a specific
set of allowable paths.
