# Mission 3
https://www.hackthissite.org/playlevel/3/

From: PeacePoetry

Message: I run this website where people can read and submit peace-related poetry. I am doing this out of good will towards others, and I don't see why I would be making enemies out of this, but some real ass hole hacked my website posting a bunch of ignorant aggressive propaganda on the front page. And I made that website a while ago, and I no longer have access to it. Do you think you can hack in and change it back? Please? Oh, and bonus points if you message me the name of the bastard who did this!

**Answer:** Think about the objective of this mission: we want to restore the site to its state before getting hacked. This means a couple of things:
* We need to find the code of what the site looked like before getting hacked.
* Once we find the code of what the site looked like, we'll need to find a mechanism to get that code back onto the site.
* A corollary to the prior point is: if we can find a way to change the code on part of the site, that's probably the same mechanism the hackers used to deface the site in the first place.

If we click into the mission itself, we're taken to the defaced page (the mid-2000s bent to the hacked content seems so...idyllic, looking back on it). Check the raw HTML to see if there's anything we can learn, and sure enough, at the very bottom (you need to scroll all the way to the bottom), there's this:  
`<!--Note to the webmasterThis website has been hacked, but not totally destroyed. The old website is still up. I simply copied the old index.html file to oldindex.html and remade this one. Sorry about the inconvenience.-->`

This tells us:
* The old index page is still up. That's where we can get the code of what the site looked like before getting hacked.
* The hacker copied the original index.html file to oldindex.html and then put the defaced content on index.html. Seems like whatever vulnerability is at play here allowed the hacker to manipulate multiple files, not just index.html.

Searching queries like [website edit files vulnerability] led me to references of path traversal and directory traversal. This led me [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) and then [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal), where I found a great overview. This seems important to the end solution. This type of attack involves being able to access files and directories across a site, similar to what we see happening in this mission.

Go back to the other detail we've discovered, that the old index page is available at oldindex.html. Try accessing it by going to https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html. This is the main page of the site before it was hacked, complete with the raw HTML we want to put back on the real index.html page. We can simply copy the raw HTML if needed.

The old index page has two links, one to an area to read submitted poems and one to submit a new poem. Clicking either link leads to a URL ending in .php: https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/readpoems.php or https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php. 

This means there are some PHP scripts running on the backend, which is good to know. If you click any of the poems, like https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/readpoem.php?name=Hacker, you'll see the resulting URL contains a query parameter (the name=Hacker) part. This also means there's a database functionality.

Finally, if you navigate to https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php specifically, you'll see there's a way for anyone to submit a poem to the site. There's also this message:  
`Note: Poems will be stored online immediately but will not be listed on the main poetry page until it has a chance to be looked at.`

Putting it all together, we have our framework for a solution:
* We have the code we need to restore the old HTML on the index.html page.
* The site's running PHP scripts and has a backend database. The backend database, per the note on https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php, will store submitted data immediately without any delay.
* The path traversal vulnerability basically describes being able to input content into a form which takes advantage of a backend script and database to post content to files -- or create new files -- on a site.

So now, visit https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/submitpoems.php. Enter `../index.html` as the Name of poem, which I picked up from the articles about path traversal. Paste the raw HTML from https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html in the Poem box. Press add poem, and you're done. Youâ€™ll have successfully rewritten the index.html file with the original contents, and as you can see, this is exactly what the hackers did to deface the site in the first place. Now, if only we could help PeacePoetry get access to the site to fix this underlying problem.

**Key Ideas:** Like the other missions so far, this one isn't about breaking into the site, per se, but rather it's about abusing features already present on the site to achieve your objective. In addition, a path traversal attack is probably how a lot of hackers deface legitimate websites as well as [access files](https://hackernoon.com/the-power-of-directory-traversal-93e8dfd608ef) webmasters otherwise try to keep hidden.
