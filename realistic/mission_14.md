## Overview
An internet start-up is rumoured to be selling user data and usage habits to
advertisers while they claim the opposite. Hack in and get some proof.

From:

Message: You've probably heard of Yuppers Internet Solutions before. They
started in 1997 and are now one of the top websites on the net. I was an intern
at Yuppers for a time, but quit when I learned that the admins were selling user
data and usage habits to advertisers while saying the opposite. Unfortunately, I
couldn't get out of the building with any proof and don't have any high-level
access. I do know, however, that much of the coding on their site was done by
amateurs and is probably insecure. Can you hack in and get some proof?

## Solution
### Properly Solving This Mission in the 2020s Isn't Possible
This mission was meant to demonstrate the value of null byte attacks. The
places, however, where you're supposed to use characters which resolve to null
bytes don't seem to work anymore. It's possible the backend servers don't accept
these characters anymore, but I also think there is now filtering in modern web
browsers to prevent users from passing in null bytes. See
[here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=106991) for an
example of a Chromium discussion and
[here](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0842) for a CVE
report. Having said that, null byte attacks do seem to be theoretically possible
still, as [this
report](https://samcurry.net/filling-in-the-blanks-exploiting-null-byte-buffer-overflow-for-a-40000-bounty/)
demonstrates.

For the purposes of this mission I'll continue to outline what I found to be the
steps to finish the mission, but note that a big part of it isn't really
reproducible anymore.

### Details from the Site Layout
The mission site has the look and feel of what Yahoo looked like in the late
1990s. I guess this mission was made before Google superseded Yahoo as the
dominant search engine. If you click through the pages you'll see basic versions
of what a search engine, even in the 2020s, offers: results for web search,
news, and finance, and functionalities for email, webpage development, and
connecting with other people. 

The mission solution likely involves some way of getting admin access, so I
thought an initial step would be to make an account, similar to what we did in
[Realistic Mission
8](https://github.com/jasonally/hack_this_site_missions/blob/master/realistic/mission_08.md).
I couldn't get the feature to work and I wasn't able to make an account, so I
figured I would look elsewhere.

### Functionalities Vulnerable to SQL Injection
Several functionalities have pages which take in URL parameters, including the
pages for search, news, and finance. Trying SQL injection inputs is an obvious
first step, similar to what we did in [Realistic Mission
9](https://github.com/jasonally/hack_this_site_missions/blob/master/realistic/mission_09.md).
The news URLs eventually stand out, because URLs for nonexistent news articles
like https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=20 return
a strange error message: `Failed to load 20.news`.

The backend program takes the URL, grabs whatever value you provide for story,
and looks for a file containing that value and a .news suffix. This isn't a
definitive article not found error message we'd expect to see, and it's a hint
this can be tampered with.

What's more, trying a URL with a story value of ., like
[https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=.](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=.),
gives us an even more enticing error message: `Failed to load ..news`. In normal
conditions this functionality is basically loading a file. What if we could
tamper with the URL to essentially tell the backend to ignore the .news part?
What would happen? That's where the null byte input comes in.

### Using a Null Byte Input to List Directory Contents
A [null byte
injection](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246949/Null%20Byte%20Injection)
involves a user providing an input which, once decoded, resolves to a null byte.
On the backend, if unfiltered, this will cause the backend system to stop
processing the string containing the user input. This abrupt termination can
cause unusual and unexpected behavior in the application.

The URI encoding for a null byte value is %00. What if we added that to our
[https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=.](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=.)
URL to get
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=.%00? We'd be
telling the backend to stop processing the script immediately and ignore the
.news part. Wonder what we would get.

When this part of the mission still worked, navigating to our URL containing the
null byte would've given us a page containing a bunch of backend code not meant
for the frontend. It would look like
[this](https://www.aldeid.com/w/images/5/5f/Hackthissite-14-1.png). It's tough
to decipher, but this output lists the site's directory tree. This is similar to
what we were able to do using a SQL injection in [insert missions].

Two files stand out: administrator.cgi and moderator.cgi. If you try accessing
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/adminstrator.cgi, you'll get
a 404 error saying this page doesn't exist and never did. It would be more
convincing if this page wasn't clearly listed in the directory tree, so if
there's really a page here, we can't access it right now. Accessing
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/moderator.cgi, meanwhile,
takes us to a form which requires us to provide a moderator ID. This is
promising, and clearly something ordinary Yuppers users shouldn't be able to
access, but we don't know how to proceed. If only there was more we could learn
about this moderator.cgi script.

### Using a Null Byte Input to Read Files
We already used a null byte input to manipulate
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story= to list
directory contents. Can we use it to display file contents? Yes â€“ at least back
when the mission worked properly.

All we had to do was try accessing
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/news.cgi?story=moderator.cgi%00.
Given what we've discovered already about this site's vulnerability to null byte
inputs, it's not hard to imagine what happened on the backend. In short, by
using the null byte input to terminate the string processing, we're preventing
the backend from affixing .news to the end of our moderator.cgi input. This
would cause the backend to literally read the contents of moderator.cgi and
print its contents to the frontend. The result would be something like
[this](https://www.aldeid.com/w/images/8/84/Hackthissite-14-3.png) and
[this](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/File:Hackthissite-14-4.png).

### Bypassing Security Privileges
Like with [Realistic Mission
13](https://github.com/jasonally/hack_this_site_missions/blob/master/realistic/mission_13.md),
we've would've had to do some parsing of code and error messages. There would be
a block of code which really stood out:
```
if (isadmin($ret[0]))
{
print "Admin Account
";
}
```

isadmin is a value associated with admin accounts, one of which we're trying to
identify and access. Maybe it's something we can spoof on the moderator lookup
page. If we go back to
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/moderator.cgi, enter isadmin
into the search box, and select log in, it takes us to Yuppers' moderator panel.

The moderator panel allows us to view account info for a given account username,
or email traffic for a given email address. But it turns out there's a
deceptively simple flaw with the account info lookup. Entering * is the
equivalent of a SELECT * SQL statement on the backend, and will list info for
all admin accounts. Enter * in the View Account Info box, click submit, and
there's our admin username and password information we need.

### Logging into the Admin Account
The last part of this mission is easy. Navigate to the Yuppers login page at
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/login.html, log in using the
username and password we've just obtained, and you're taken to
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/webpermit/login.cgi. The page
now has a link to the administrator panel at
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/14/administrator.cgi, and going
there completes the mission.

## Key Concepts
SQL injection, specifically null byte injection\
Local file intrusion

## Key Ideas
### Hints About Backend Scripts
Like with several realistic missions, the first key to finding a vulnerable part
of the site was getting an unexpectedly helpful error message. In this mission,
it was finding out the news functionality loaded files with a .news suffix. This
provided a clue as to how we might be able to get the site to behave outside of
its intended purpose by bypassing this part of the backend code. We needed the
right tool to do this, however, which in the past was using the null byte
injection.

### Usefulness of Null Byte Injections
You can still find working null byte injection vulnerabilities in web
applications, even if their existence has diminished throughout the 2010s. For
instance, PHP 5.3.4 fixed [a major null byte injection
bug](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39863), which was released in December
2010. Even if you find a site on the web today with an outdated version of PHP,
hopefully it's at least got PHP 5.3.4 which fixes up this security hole.

But the idea of what the null byte injection in this mission helped us
accomplish is worth pondering. In this mission, it helped us find an admin
account and gain access to it. That idea still lives on though other types of
attacks, some of which didn't even exist in the early 2000s. For instance, at
the time of this writing, less than a week ago there was a major attack against
Twitter. How attackers did what they did is still under investigation, but [SIM
swapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) may [have been a
factor](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/)
to help the attackers get admin access.
